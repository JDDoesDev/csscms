  <h1 id="toc_0">Enter the Bash commands</h1>

  <p>In order to be a CMS, I need a way to programatically generate the files that are needed to make a new post happen. I also want to swap around variables to utilize the unique identifier, which in this case is the post name itself. </p>
  
  <p>I call it <code>postcreator.sh</code> because that is what it does. It uses <code>cp</code>, <code>sed</code>, and <code>ex</code> to get this done. No expternal libraries, just what is in bash.  Not tested on Linux, just a Macbook air as of the time of this writing.  And when did I write this?  Do you care? You COULD look at the <code>git log</code> to see when this file was made or modified. I am likely capable of someone leveraging HTML or something to grab the date when I post, but that is not in this version as of now.  </p>
  
  <p>But what about search and replace for things like the links in the header and such? Well, since we are working locally as the IDE I can juse use good old <code>sed</code> to replace an strings I want in the whole dang set of documents. I don&#39;t want to reinvent any wheels, especially <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11392478/how-to-replace-a-string-in-multiple-files-in-linux-command-line/29191549">when the directions are as simple as this</a></p>
  
  <p>Anyhow, get the postcreator tool as part of your clone of the <a href="https://github.com/mcdwayne/csscms">whole repo over from github</a>.</p>
